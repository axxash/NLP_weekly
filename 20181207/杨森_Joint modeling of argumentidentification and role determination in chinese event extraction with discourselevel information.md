### 摘要
Argument extraction is a challenging task in event
extraction. However, most of previous studies
focused on intra-sentence information and failed to
extract inter-sentence arguments. This paper
proposes a discourse-level joint model of argument
identification and role determination to infer those
inter-sentence arguments in a discourse. Moreover,
to better represent the relationship among relevant
event mentions and the relationship between an
event mention and its arguments in a discourse, this
paper introduces various kinds of corpus-based and
discourse-based constraints in the joint model,
either automatically learned or linguistically
motivated. Evaluation on the ACE 2005 Chinese
corpus justifies the effectiveness of our joint model
over a strong baseline in Chinese argument
extraction, in particular argument identification. 

### 推荐理由
13年的一篇文章，将事件抽取划分成了经典的四个阶段：触发词识别，触发词分类，角色识别，角色分类，后续很多工作基于这四个步骤开展实验进行对比，此篇论文对事件抽取方面有参考价值
