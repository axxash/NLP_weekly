### 摘要
We introduce a new language representa- tion model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language repre- sentation models (Peters et al., 2018; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT representations can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the- art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art re- sults on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE bench- mark to 80.4% (7.6% absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (5.6% abso- lute improvement) and the SQuAD v1.1 ques- tion answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 absolute improvement), outperforming human perfor- mance by 2.0.

### 推荐理由
本文介绍了一种新的语言表征模型 BERT。与最近的语言表征模型不同，BERT旨在基于双向上下文来预训练表征。BERT是首个基于fine-tuning的在sentence level和token level任务中去的state of art的表征模型，其性能超越许多使用面向特定任务架构的系统，刷新了11项NLP任务的当前记录。
